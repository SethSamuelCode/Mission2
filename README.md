- HTML elements have .dataset feature you can pragmatically add and get data from.
- Dont use objects as a key to access things. 
- If you dont get an error and your code doesnt know work how you expect check functions and variables are in the correct scope.
- you can clear arrays by setting its length to 0;
- you can attach an event listener to anything 
- you can make anything a button 
- web scripting is mostly event-driven and doesnt have much top down programming flow.
